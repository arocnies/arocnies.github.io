Often I find a need to include a GUI with some project. In the past I've used a variety of solutions; Python computer vision project? I chose **Qt GUI**. Network security visualization? That one got an **Angular (Dart) webui**. And for others, plenty of **Java Swing** based GUIs and graphs.

Back in the early days of Kotlin/JS (2018), it wasn't as obvious how to organize your project and a few different options were available.

I create this SVG Random Art generator to try out Kotlin/JS and learn how to structure a Kotlin/JS project with it being rendered and published as a gh-pages site.

It's a simple project with a few quarks (like favoring the bottom right corner--which ended up looking good). Ultimately it served the purpose of breaking the ice for creating simple web UIs using Kotlin.

> Kotlin/JS is now released. Use the project generator to get an easy start with Kotlin/JS instead of copying this project's structure.
